### Front-end
- Build on existing functionality to include images and video
- Streamline the interface to make it more user-friendly

### Back-end
- Build A.I. for deepfake detection (JavaScript?)
- MongoDB should make indexing much easier due to its non-structured format
- Will not require modifications to database structure (since it's adaptable)
- Indexing will be be improved with keywords. For example, while searching
  for "social media" within the db, the results returned are only those matching 
  the search words exactly. To counter this, while uploading an incident, the 
  user could attach tags that would expand on said search.
